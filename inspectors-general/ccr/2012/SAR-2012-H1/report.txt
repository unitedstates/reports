                                          INTRODUCTION
THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS
The United States Commission on Civil Rights (Commission), created pursuant to the Civil
Rights Act of 1957, 1 is responsible for (1) investigating allegations of discrimination because of
color, race, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin or deprivation of voting rights, and (2)
collecting and studying information; monitoring the enforcement of federal laws and policies;
serving as a national clearinghouse for information; and preparing public service
announcements and advertising campaigns on issues pertaining to discrimination, denials of
equal protection of the laws, or the administration of justice. The Commission may hold
hearings and, within specific guidelines, issue subpoenas to obtain certain records and have
witnesses appear at hearings. It also maintains state advisory committees and consults with
representatives of federal, state, and local governments and private organizations to advance its
fact-finding work.

The Commission is required to issue reports on the findings of its investigations to Congress
and the President and to recommend legislative remedies. The Commission also must submit
annually to Congress and the President at least one report that monitors federal civil rights
enforcement in the United States. In addition, because it lacks enforcement powers that would
enable it to apply remedies in individual cases, the Commission refers specific complaints it
receives to the appropriate federal, state, or local government agency for action.

THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The Inspector General of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was created by the Consolidated
and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012. 2 The duties, responsibilities, and authorities
of the Commission’s Inspector General are specified in the Inspector General Act of 1978, as
amended. 3 The act further designated that the Inspector General of the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) holds the position of Inspector General of the Commission and
directed that personnel of GAO’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) be utilized to perform the
duties of the Inspector General for the Commission. The Inspector General shall conduct audits
and investigations relating to programs and operations administered or financed by the
Commission and keep the Commissioners and Congress fully and currently informed
concerning fraud or other serious problems, abuses, and deficiencies identified.

      ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
AUDITS, INSPECTIONS, AND EVALUATIONS
During this first reporting period, we gained an understanding of the mission and operations of
the Commission to identify potential risks and areas for future work. We interviewed
Commission staff, and reviewed past GAO reports, Commission budget information,
performance and accountability reports, and administrative instructions of its internal operations.

On March 15, 2012, OIG reported that the Commission did not include information related to
improper payments in its fiscal year 2011 performance and accountability report. 4 Further, it was
reported that the Commission was not in compliance with both the Improper Payments
Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 and Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) guidance
for implementing this act because the Commission did not (1) institute a risk assessment to
identify those programs and activities susceptible to significant improper payments or (2) seek a
waiver from OMB for conducting such an assessment. Commission personnel stated that they
did not do a risk assessment since the Commission’s $9.4 million in appropriations received for
fiscal year 2011 was less than the $10 million minimum reporting threshold for significant
improper payments. 5

INVESTIGATIONS
An OIG hotline was established for reporting suspected fraud, waste, and abuse within the
Commission and information about the hotline was circulated and posted at the Commission.
OIG also has implemented an integrity awareness initiative to inform employees of their
responsibilities for the prevention of fraud and to reinforce employees’ roles in helping to ensure
the integrity of the Commission’s operations.
We received three hotline contacts. We closed one after an initial review determined there was
no basis for further action and opened two investigations.

OTHER ACTIVITIES
REGULATORY REVIEW
OIG did not perform reviews of existing legislation and regulations relating to programs and
operations of the Commission and we did not identify any proposed legislation and regulations.
PEER REVIEW
Established in November 2011, OIG did not schedule or undergo a peer review. Further, OIG
did not participate in any peer review activity for other offices of federal inspectors general.

 Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights: Compliance
with the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, OIG/USCCR-12-1 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 15,
2012).
5
 As defined by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111-204, 124 Stat. 224
[July 22, 2010]), significant improper payments are gross annual improper payments in the program exceeding (1)
both 2.5 percent of program outlays and $10 million of all program or activity payments during the fiscal year reported
or (2) $100 million (regardless of the improper payment error rate).
