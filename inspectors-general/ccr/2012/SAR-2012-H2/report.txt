                                          INTRODUCTION
THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS
The United States Commission on Civil Rights (Commission), created pursuant to the
Civil Rights Act of 1957,1 is responsible for (1) investigating allegations of discrimination
because of color, race, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin or deprivation of
voting rights, and (2) collecting and studying information; monitoring the enforcement of
federal laws and policies; serving as a national clearinghouse for information; and
preparing public service announcements and advertising campaigns on issues
pertaining to discrimination, denials of equal protection of the laws, or the administration
of justice. The Commission may hold hearings and, within specific guidelines, issue
subpoenas to obtain certain records and have witnesses appear at hearings. It also
maintains state advisory committees and consults with representatives of federal, state,
and local governments and private organizations to advance its fact-finding work.

The Commission is required to issue reports on the findings of its investigations to
Congress and the President, and to recommend legislative remedies. The Commission
also must submit annually to Congress and the President at least one report that
monitors federal civil rights enforcement in the United States. In addition, because it
lacks enforcement powers that would enable it to apply remedies in individual cases,
the Commission refers specific complaints it receives to the appropriate federal, state,
or local government agency for action.

THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The Inspector General of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was created by the
Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012.2 The duties,
responsibilities, and authorities of the Commission’s Inspector General are specified in
the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended.3 The act further designated that the
Inspector General of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) holds the position of
Inspector General of the Commission, and directed that personnel of GAO’s Office of
Inspector General (OIG) be utilized to perform the duties of the Inspector General for
the Commission. The Inspector General shall conduct audits and investigations relating
to programs and operations administered or financed by the Commission and keep the
Commissioners and Congress fully and currently informed concerning fraud or other
serious problems, abuses, and deficiencies identified.
