Letter

The Honorable Martin R. Castro
Chairman
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20425

Dear Chairman Castro:

I am submitting this semiannual report in accordance with Section 5 of the Inspector
General Act of 1978, as amended. The report summarizes the activities of the
Inspector General for the period April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2013. The act
requires that you transmit the report to the appropriate congressional committees
within 30 days of receipt. Your transmittal should also include any comments you
consider appropriate and other statistical tables and reports required by law.

During this semiannual period, the OIG initiated an inspection of state advisory
committee (SAC) chairpersons to obtain their views on the SAC’s ability to inform the
Commission on civil rights issues. In addition, we processed four hotline complaints
and closed one investigation.

I appreciate the Civil Rights Commission’s support and look forward to working with
you to help promote economy and efficiency in the operations of the Commission.

Respectfully submitted,




Adam R. Trzeciak
Inspector General

INTRODUCTION
THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (Commission), created pursuant to the Civil Rights
Act of 1957, 1 is responsible for investigating allegations of voting rights deprivations
because of color, race, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin or as a result of
any pattern or practice of fraud. In addition, the Commission is also responsible for
performing the following functions regarding discrimination, denials of equal protection
of the laws, or the administration of justice because of color, race, religion, sex, age,
disability or national origin: (a) collecting and studying information; (b) making
appraisals of federal laws and policies; (c) serving as a national clearinghouse for
information; and (d) preparing public service announcements and advertising
campaigns. The Commission may hold hearings and, within specific guidelines, issue
subpoenas to obtain certain records and require witnesses to appear at hearings. It is
also required to maintain state advisory committees and consult with representatives of
federal, state, and local governments and private organizations to advance its fact-
finding work.

The Commission is required to issue reports on its investigative findings to Congress
and the President, and to recommend legislative remedies. The Commission also must
submit annually to Congress and the President at least one report that monitors federal
civil rights enforcement in the United States. In addition, because it lacks enforcement
powers that would enable it to apply remedies in individual cases, the Commission
refers specific complaints it receives to the appropriate federal, state, or local
government agencies for action.

THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012 designated the
Inspector General of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to serve as the
Inspector General of the Commission. 2 As such, GAO’s Office of Inspector General
(OIG) independently performs the duties and has the responsibilities and authorities of
the Commission’s Inspector General as specified in the Inspector General Act of 1978,
as amended. 3 The Inspector General of the Commission is authorized to audit and
investigate programs and operations administered or financed by the Commission, and
to keep the Commissioners and Congress fully and currently informed about fraud or
other serious problems, abuses, and deficiencies we identify.

ACTIVITIES OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
AUDITS, INSPECTIONS, AND EVALUATIONS
During this reporting period, we initiated an inspection to survey state advisory
committee (SAC) chairpersons on the SACs ability to inform the Commission on civil
rights issues. In a prior report, we identified the need for the Commission to better use
its SACs to help achieve its mission. 4

INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES
The Inspector General received four new hotline complaints. As shown in table 1, we
closed one investigation and did not open any new investigations. At the end of the
reporting period, three investigations remained open.

OTHER ACTIVITIES
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REVIEW
As required by the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, the OIG reviews
proposed legislation and regulations to assess whether the proposed legislation or
regulations impacts the economy and efficiency of the Commission’s programs and
operations. During this period, we identified no legislation or regulation affecting the
programs or operations of the Commission requiring Inspector General review.

PEER REVIEW
Government Auditing Standards require that each organization performing audits in
accordance with these standards must have an external peer review. The objectives of
a peer review are to determine whether an effective quality control system has been
established in the office and if policies, procedures, and applicable government auditing
standards are followed. Peer reviews must be performed at least once every 3 years by
reviewers independent of the audit organization being reviewed.

The Inspector General Act requires federal offices of inspectors general to include in
their semiannual reports to Congress the results of any peer review conducted by
another OIG during the reporting period, or, if no peer review was conducted within the
reporting period, a statement identifying the date of the last peer review conducted by
another OIG. The OIG has not undergone a peer review but in April 2013 formally
requested a peer review of our audit operations. Further, we did not conduct a peer
review of another OIG.

STATUS OF AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS
The Commission reported that it took action to close three of five OIG recommendations
related to federal information security requirements. 5 Two recommendations related to
configuration management and risk management remained open.
