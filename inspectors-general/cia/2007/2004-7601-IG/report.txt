  (b)(3) NatSecActieved to be an al-Qa'ida terrorist traveling on a false German
               passport.1 Based on this allegation, OIG initiated an investigation into
  I            the circumstances surrounding al-Masri's rendition and detention. In
               late August 2004, the Inspector General (IG) reported this issue to the
  I            then Acting Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) as a "particularly
               serious problem" within the meaning of Section 17 of the CIA Act.

  I           l (S//?ff) ln a sllbsequent debriefing session with ClA officers on 11February2004, al-Masri
              advised that his lull name was Khalid 'Abd al-Razzaq nl-Mnsri. This Report refers to him as

                  Most importantly, the purported connections to the al-Qa'ida
                  operative in Sudan, which served as the underpinning for the
   I              rendition, were tenuous, circumstantial, and produced no further
                  incriminating information. Nonetheless, the two Agency officers
      I           primarily involved in al-Masri's rendition justified their commitment

   I            and detaining al-Masri did not meet the standard specified in the
                Presidential MON of 17 September 2001. According to the MON, the
                individual in question "must pose a continuing, serious threat of
   I            violence or death to U.S. persons and interests" or must be "planning
                terrorist activities." The Agency never documented or established
   I            grounds for concluding that al-Masri posed such a threat.
                Furthermore, the language used in the cable of justification did not
   I            meet the standard specified by the MON. The cable claimed only that
                al-Masri might know key Information that could leaci to the capture of
                other al-Qa'ida operatives. Virtually all of the Agency-lawyers
   I            interviewed by OIG for this investigation confirmed that possessing
               .such knowledge would not constitute sufficient grounds for rendition.

               information about the status of his case until the week before he was
               returned to Germany in late May 2004. During this time, according to               I
               the report of an Agency psychologist, al-Masri appeared desperate and
               depressed and prone to thoughts of suicide. Al-Masri conducted at least

   I              logically raiSes questions about the system the Agency created to
                  conduct and oversee its rendition and detention process. The lack of
                  rigor in justifying action against an individual suspected of terrorist
   I              connections; the lack of understanding of the legal requirements of
                  detention and rendition; the Jack of guidance provided to officers
   I              making critical operational decisions with significant international
                  implications; and the lack of management oversight suggest that a
   I              review of the Agency's rendition and detention processes should be
                  undertaken.

   I                   12. (5//1'.f:F) This Report concludes that there was an·
               insufficient basis to render and detain al-Masri and the Agency's
   I           prolonged detention of al-Masri was unjustified. His rendition and
   (~gl NatSec.1:;;pg detention resulted from a series of breakdowns in tradecraft,
    I          process, management, and oversight. CTC and                      failed
               to take responsible steps to verify al-Masri's identity. ALEC Station
               exaggerated the nature of the data it possessed linking al-Masri to
   I           terrorism.3 After the decision had been made to repatriate al-Masri,

                        13. ('f5/A                     r,LNF) The Report also concludes thatC(b)(?)fcl

(b)(1)               was dead)." The report said that the source of al-Masri's frustration was the
(b)(3) CIAAct        unknown status of his case .and the uncertain length of his detention,
(b )(3) NatSecAct complicated by lack of interaction with Agency personnel. The lack of                                      I

                     debriefing sessions, had "prevented him from developing a context, time line, or
                     understanding of his detention." According to the report, al-Masri "strongly

                     skills." The report concluded that, "Without being given some feedback on his

                     deteriorate."                                                                                           I

                     updated psychological assessment of al-Masri with the aid of an Arabic linguist

(b)(1)               that was reported!              lin a cable to Headquarters. In the report, the

   b )(3) NatSecAct warned though that, "The next few weeks will be critical in maintaining his
                     mental health, and any undue delay in his release could send him into another

                     anger may fester, thereby causing potential long-term issues for HQs." The
                     psychologist noted that al-Masri had rebounded from his previous.bouts with
                     depression and that he was psychologically stable with "no evidence of any
                                                                                                                             I

 I               (DoJ) attorneys regarding the al-Masri matter periodically

                 Counterterrorism Section of the National Security Division believed
 I               the infonnation contained in this Report provided sufficient
                 justificatlon for an OIG referral to DoJ. The Chief advised that such a
 I               referral should not delay publication of a Report of Investigation or
                 any administrative action by the Agency. The matter was

 I               subsequently referred to DoJ in writing. The Department of Justice,
                 In turn, transferred the matter to the Office of the United States
                 Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. On 29 May 2007, the US
 I               Atto1ney, EDY A reported, by letter, that they declined to pursue
                 federal prosecution in this matter in favor of possible administrative
 I               action by the Agency.

   I                    198. (S//NT) Available intelligence information did not pro,1ide
                 a sufficient basis to render and detain Khalid al-Masri. Further, the
   I             Agency's prolonged detention of al-Masri· was unjustified. Al-Masri's
                 rendition and long detention resulted from a breakdown in tradecraft
   I             and legal oversight. After the decision had been made to repatriate
                 al-Masri, implementation was delayed by bureaucratic infighting.

                  that al-Masri was subjected to physical abuse of any kind while in CIA
    I             custody. Evidence gathered during the investigation suggests that the
                  experience that gave rise to al-Masri's allegation he was sodomized
    I             was, in fact, a routine rectal examination conducted by a physician's
                  assistant during his initial medical examination. The investigation also
    I             found that al-Masri's rendition was conducted according to Agency
(b)(1)            protocols. During his confinement in CIA custody, al-Masri was cut off

     I            some clothing, bedding, and a bucket for his waste, and provided with
                  adequate medical attention. Al-Masri engaged in a hunger strike in
   I              April 2004. He ended his hunger strike when faced with the possibility
                  of being force-fed.

   I                   214. (S//NF) The Agency did not inform Congress of its
                mistaken rendition and detention of al-Masri until 2 June 2004-after
   I            al-Masri's repatriation and after the German Governn1ent had been
                informed. The Agency provided 'more information to Congress in
   I            July 2004, after it lean1ed that al-Masri had retained an attorney. The
                Agency did not, in either notification, inform Congress that CIA
